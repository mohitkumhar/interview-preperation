Given two strings, a text string txt and a pattern string pat, both consisting of lowercase English alphabets. Return the starting indices (0-based) of all the occurrences of the pattern string pat in the text string txt.

Note: Return an empty list in case of no occurrences of pattern.

Examples:

Input: txt = "geeksforgeeks", pat = "geek"
Output: [0, 8]

Input: txt = "aabaacaadaabaaba", pat = "aaba"
Output: [0, 9, 12]
Explanation:

Constraints:
1 ≤ txt.size() ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ pat.size() ≤ txt.size()

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n + m)
Auxiliary Space: O(m)

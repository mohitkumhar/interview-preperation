Check for Prime Number

You are given an integer n. You need to check if the number is prime or not.
Return true if it is a prime number, otherwise return false.

A prime number is a number which has no divisors except 1 and itself.

Example 1
Input: n = 5
Output: true
Explanation: The only divisors of 5 are 1 and 5 , So the number 5 is prime.

Example 2
Input: n = 8
Output: false
Explanation: The divisors of 8 are 1, 2, 4, 8, thus it is not a prime number.

Constraints
1 <= n <= 5000
"""

n = 123
is_prime = True

for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
    if n % i == 0:
        is_prime = False
        break

print(is_prime)

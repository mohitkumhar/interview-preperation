Divisors of a Number

You are given an integer n.
You need to find all the divisors of n.
Return all the divisors of n as an array or list in a sorted order.


A number which completely divides another number is called it's divisor.


Example 1
Input: n = 6
Output = [1, 2, 3, 6]
Explanation: The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.

Example 2
Input: n = 8
Output: [1, 2, 4, 8]
Explanation: The divisors of 8 are 1, 2, 4, 8.

Constraints
1 <= n <= 1000

"""

n = 6
result = []

for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if n % i == 0:
        result.append(i)

print(result)
